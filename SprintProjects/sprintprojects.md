(Why Vite ( pronounced "veet"))['https://vite.dev/guide/why.html']

Summary - Javascript projects are getting bigger, involving more code and more packages. This is results in longer bundling times. Modern bundlers like webpack, parcel, and rollup are slow. Vite compiles code for javascript based projects and gets them into the browser faster. The difference is minutes to bundle vs. seconds.
